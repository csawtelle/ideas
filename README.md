My idea would be to create a neural network trained on (3d model -> point cloud) and then have it generate a point cloud
automatically, maybe tuning features? Then convert from (point cloud -> 3d model). In this way you could say something like
"pirate chair" and it would create a chair that is sort of piratey? Not sure.. Just an idea
